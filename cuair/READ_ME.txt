This file contains the code for the spellchecker challenge.
The spellchecker works off of the Levenshtein distance.
I also implemented checks for similar letters such as "c" and "k", or "s" and "c".
Beyond that, I also have implementation for letters that are close to eachother (such as "q" and "w")
